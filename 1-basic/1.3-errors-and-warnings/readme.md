# Errors and Warnings

In C++ programming, errors and warnings are important indicators of issues in your code. Understanding these messages and knowing how to address them is crucial for writing reliable and maintainable software.

## Common Errors

### Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when the code violates the language's grammar rules. These errors prevent the code from compiling.

Examples:

- Missing semicolon at the end of a statement.
- Unclosed parentheses or curly braces.

### Logic Errors

Logic errors, also known as bugs, occur when the code compiles successfully but does not produce the expected results due to flawed logic.

Examples:

- Incorrect formula or algorithm.
- Wrong variable assignment.
- Off-by-one errors.

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur during program execution. They can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior.

Examples:

- Division by zero.
- Accessing an array index out of bounds.
- Memory allocation failures.

## Common Warnings

### Unused Variables

Warnings are issued by the compiler to indicate potential issues in the code that do not prevent compilation but may lead to unexpected behavior or inefficiency.

Examples:

- Declaring a variable but not using it.

### Type Conversion Warnings

C++ can issue warnings when converting between different data types, such as narrowing conversions that may result in data loss.

Examples:

- Converting a floating-point number to an integer.

**Note:** Error and warning messages can vary depending on the compiler you use. Always refer to your specific compiler's documentation for detailed information on error and warning messages.
