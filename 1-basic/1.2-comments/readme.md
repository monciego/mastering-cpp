# Comments

In C++, comments are used to add explanatory notes or documentation within your code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the program's functionality. They are essential for making your code more readable and for providing information to other developers (including your future self) about the code's purpose and functionality.

## Types of Comments

There are two main types of comments in C++:

1. **Single-line comments**: These comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. Single-line comments are typically used for brief explanations or notes.

2. **Multi-line comments**: These comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. Multi-line comments can span multiple lines and are useful for longer explanations or comments that cover multiple lines of code.

### Single-line Comment

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-line Comment

```cpp
/*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
*/
```
